The interface of the site is extremely **simple** on purpose, so that the user can fully **focus on the content** of the pieces without being distracted by any unneeded graphical interference.

In addition, content readability is always at the best thanks to a robust **responsive adaptive layout** and a flexible **responsive typography**.

</div>

For what concerns the **logo**/**favicon** of the site, what better way to represent the concept of sempiternity—existence within time but infinitely into the future—than a circular, indeterminate progress indicator?

Such circular existence within time is reiterated by the **background color** of the page, which hue is cyclically rotated over time according to the hour of the day.

Pieces in Sempiternity often share a common **motif**, which is identifiable thanks to the **pixel art icon** opening the short story.
