This archive aims at replicating the way a **human image search engine**[^flesh] might work. As opposed to the typical image search engine, which returns a set of images based on the user's query, a human image search engine is consciously **powered by multiple users**, who search and return visual responses to each other[^process].

For the sake of simplicity and consistency such **replication** is kept on a **small scale**, that is, all collaborative efforts collected through this site focus on replying to just one single predefined **query word**: ***dream***.

<div class="figures">
    {% include image.html 
        size="m" 
        h="1" w="1" 
        src="fortune_cookie_index_360_00.jpg" 
        alt="A screenshot of the website Fortune Cookie." 
        color="#6362E0" 
    %}
    {% include image.html 
        size="m" 
        h="1" w="1" 
        src="fortune_cookie_call_360_00.jpg" 
        alt="A screenshot of the website Fortune Cookie." 
        color="#6362E0" 
    %}
</div>

Web travelers are invited to fuel the archive by submitting their own visual interpretation in response to the predefined query word/abstract concept dream.

The **query word** ***dream*** was chosen because it is an **abstract** term and thus susceptible of **multiple subjective interpretations**[^retrieval]—a problematic case for image search engines, since they can not know beforehand which interpretation the user is looking for.

In the beginning the **interface** of the archive was designed to work similarly to the one of an ordinary image search engine interface: regretfully, a **compromise** with **copyright law**[^laws] on the Internet was required and it was adapted to the current way it works.

After having read that even using a **thumbnail** counterpart of a **copyrighted image** in a web page for the mere sake of documenting such resource—like image search engines usually do—could be well enough to be deemed as **copyright infringement**, it was preferred not to use any thumbnails extracted from the originals.

For the above reason, all the thumbnails of the images collected in the archive are generated by **scrambling** the **pixels** of their original counterparts.

<div class="figures">
    {% include image.html 
        size="m" 
        h="4" w="3" 
        src="fortune_cookie_installation_768_00.jpg" 
        alt="A screenshot of the website Fortune Cookie." 
        color="#6362E0" 
    %}
</div>

The image archive was physically correlated in the installation of the same name set up on occasion of the exhibition ***Can we please play the internet?***.

[^flesh]: The grand-scale **collaboration** at the basis of a human image search engine would be similar to the one of a [human flesh search engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_flesh_search_engine "Human flesh search engine on Wikipedia"), but with a focus on just images.

[^process]: The goal here is subverting the **top-down process** typical of standard search engines, transforming it into a **bottom-up** one.

[^retrieval]: > “**Image retrieval** for abstract concepts is the search for image content that is not directly present in the image, but needs to be **inferred** from **background knowledge and experience**.”

    —Ron Besseling in *Designing an Image Retrieval Interface for Abstract Concepts Within the Domain of Journalism*.

[^laws]: It is a **jungle**, so watch out for the tigers!
