The **simple-on-purpose** site interface lets users fully **focus on the content** of the pieces, without the risk of being distracted by any unneeded graphical interference.

The content readability is always at its best thanks to a robust **responsive adaptive layout** and a flexible **responsive typography**.

<div class="figures">
    {% include image.html
        size="m"
        h="1" w="2"
        src="sempiternity_logo_00.jpg"
        alt="The logo/favicon of Sempiternity."
        caption="The logo/favicon of Sempiternity."
        color="#EFD2D2"
    %}
</div>

The **logo**/**favicon** of the site resembles a circular, indeterminate **progress indicator**: what better way to represent the concept of sempiternity, that is none other than existence within time but infinitely into the future?

The same concept is reinforced through the **background color** of the page, which hue is cyclically rotated over time according to the hour of the day.

Pieces in Sempiternity often share a common **motif**, which is identifiable thanks to a **pixel art icon** opening the short story.
