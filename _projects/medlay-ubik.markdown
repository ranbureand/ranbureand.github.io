The slogan opening the 6<sup>th</sup> chapter of *Ubik* says:

>We wanted to give you a shave like no other you ever had. We said, it’s about time a man’s face got a little loving! We said, with Ubik’s self-winding Swiss chromium never-ending blade, the days of scrape-scrape are over! So try Ubik! And be loved!
